/// The polymorphic identity function always returns the argument it was given.
///
/// Identities can be used to enforce a relationship between two types in the name of safety.  For 
/// example, concatenation is a function on arrays of arrays, but there isn't a built-in way to 
/// express an extension of [[T]].  By using the identity as a relation the compiler is forced to 
/// only allow `concat(_:)` to be invoked with nested arrays:
///
///     extension Array {
///         /// Concatenate an array of arrays.
///         func concat(rel : [T] -> [[U]]) -> [U] {
///             return foldr({ $0 + $1 })([])(rel(self))
///         }
///     }
///
///     let flat  = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]].concat(id) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
///     // let error = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].concat(id) // Does not typecheck

/// Pipe Backward | Applies the function to its left to an argument on its right.
///
/// Chains of regular function applications are often made unnecessarily verbose and tedius by
/// large amounts of parenthesis.  Because this operator has a low precedence and is right-
/// associative, it can often be used to elide parenthesis such that the following holds:
///
///     f <<| g <<| h(x)  =  f (g (h (x)))

/// Pipe Forward | Applies the argument on its left to a function on its right.
///
/// Sometimes, a computation looks more natural when a value is computed on the right side of
/// an expression and applied to a function on the left.  For example, this:
///
///     let result = and(zip(nubBy(==)(x))(y).map(==))
///		
/// can also be written as:
///
///     let result = nubBy(==)(x) |>> zip(y)
///                               |>> map(==)
///                               |>> and

/// Function Composition | Composes the target of the left function with the source of the second
/// function to pipe the results through one larger function from right source to left target.
///
///     (g • f)(x) = g(f(x))
///
/// While the definition of this operator may seem backwards, it may help to read it as "after" to
/// see why it makes sense as-is.  As in:
///
///     h • g • f = 'h' after 'g' after 'f'

/// The fixpoint (or Y) combinator computes the least fixed point of an equation. That is, the first
/// point at which further application of x to a function is the same x.
///
///     x = f(x)
///
/// The fixpoint combinator models recursion in the untyped lambda calculus, and is notoriously
/// difficult to define and type in ML-style systems because it can often lead to paradoxes. Case in
/// point, the canonical definition of the Y combinator in Swift is as follows:
/// 
///     func Y() -> (A -> A) -> A {
///         return { f in
///             return ({ x in
///                 return f(x(x))
///             })({ x in
///                 return f(x(x))
///             })
///         }
///     }
///
/// This definition can never be typechecked by Swift because any instantiation of x must have the 
/// infinite type A : A -> B, or `A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G -> H -> I -> ...`
///
/// Because Swift is also strict by default, the traditional definition of the fixpoint combinator 
/// has been eta-expanded (i.e. it now takes itself as a parameter) to allow evaluation in constant 
/// stack space.  Without this kind of protection, fix would compute ⊥ by smashing the stack and 
/// crashing.
